# abdelrahmanmohamed1.netlify.app

Personal site of Abdelrahman Mohamed: work, experience, writing, a gallery and public site stats.
Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, deployed on Netlify. Blog posts, gallery
images and analytics live in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

## Run it

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in the GCS + admin values
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3000
```

With no GCS credentials, set `CONTENT_SOURCE=local` to use the posts in `data/blogs.json`.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server (Turbopack) |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build and server |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` | ESLint, `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright tests (set `PW_CHROME` to an installed Chrome to skip the browser download) |
| `npm run ci` | All of the above, in order |

## Where things are

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `lib/content.ts` | All profile content: intro, projects, experience, education, skills. Edit this to update the site. |
| `public/Abdelrahman_Mohamed_Resume.pdf` | The résumé every "Résumé" link points to. Replace the file, keep the name. |
| `app/page.tsx` | Home page. Sections use `components/section.tsx`. |
| `app/blogs`, `app/gallery`, `app/stats` | Writing, gallery, public stats |
| `app/admin` | Token-protected panel for publishing posts and uploading gallery images |
| `app/globals.css` | Design tokens (light and dark), the hero trace animation, post typography |
| `lib/analytics-core.ts` | Pure analytics logic, unit tested |
| `lib/analytics.ts` | Analytics storage on GCS |

## Design

Light by default, with a dark theme that follows the OS or the toggle in the header. One typeface
(Schibsted Grotesk), with JetBrains Mono only for service names in the hero trace and for code.
Colors are CSS variables on `:root` (`--paper`, `--ink`, `--graphite`, `--rule`, `--signal`,
`--trace`, `--chart`) exposed to Tailwind as `bg-paper`, `text-graphite` and so on.

The hero shows one paid sign-up moving through the CYD platform (`signupTrace` in
`lib/content.ts`). It plays once on load, replays on demand, and renders complete when the
visitor prefers reduced motion.

## Analytics

First-party and cookie based, with no third-party scripts. `components/site-analytics.tsx`
sends a page view on every route change and an event when someone clicks a tracked link
(`data-track="..."`, external links, `mailto:` and the résumé).

`POST /api/analytics/track` drops bots, localhost and opted-out browsers, decides whether the
hit is a new visitor, a first view of that page, or a first visit today using three cookies
(`pf_vid`, `pf_seen`, `pf_day`), and then:

1. **Writes the hit to its own object** in `analytics/inbox/`. GCS allows only about one write
   per second to a single object, so hits never write the totals directly. The old version did,
   and lost counts whenever two visits landed close together.
2. **Folds the inbox into `analytics/index.json`** at most every 15 seconds, from the track
   route or the stats page. The write is conditional on the object's generation, so concurrent
   compactions can't overwrite each other. The index stores the last inbox key it folded (the
   cursor), so a retry never double counts.

`/stats` shows totals, the last 30 days, top pages and posts, referrers (including `?ref=` tags,
so a résumé link can be `.../?ref=resume`) and link clicks.

- **Stop counting your own visits:** open `/api/analytics/optout` once in each browser. Use
  `/api/analytics/optout?undo=1` to start counting again.
- **Testing without touching real numbers:** set `ANALYTICS_NAMESPACE=analytics-dev` to use a
  different prefix, and `ANALYTICS_COUNT_LOCALHOST=1` to count localhost.
- **Reset:** from the admin panel, or `POST /api/analytics/reset` with `x-admin-token`.

## Environment

| Variable | Used for |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | Admin panel and admin API routes |
| `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`, `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `GCS_PRIVATE_KEY` | Signed GCS writes (posts, gallery, analytics) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GALLERY_HOST`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GALLERY_PATH` | Allowed image host for `next/image` |
| `ANALYTICS_NAMESPACE`, `ANALYTICS_COUNT_LOCALHOST` | Optional, for testing analytics |

## Deploying

Pushing to `master` deploys to Netlify (`netlify.toml` pins Node 22). Netlify refuses to deploy
Next.js versions affected by CVE-2025-55182, so keep `next` on a patched 15.5.x release. To
read a failed build's log: `netlify logs -d <deploy-id> -s deploy --since <ISO time>`.
