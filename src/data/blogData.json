          "API function calls are a way to interact with a server or service to get data or perform actions. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow developers to connect to various platforms and use their features in their own applications. Through API calls, one can request information, submit data, or perform updates in a system by sending structured requests to the service endpoints. This is especially useful when integrating AI models with external data sources, enabling them to interact dynamically with real-time data."

          "AI systems often rely on API function calls to extend their capabilities. For instance, a machine learning model can use APIs to fetch the latest financial data or weather information, enhancing decision-making and predictions. API calls can also allow AI to control IoT devices, send notifications, or even interact with other web services like Google Maps or social media platforms."

        "paragraph": [
          "Incorporating API function calls into AI projects requires understanding how to structure API requests and handle responses. Typically, this involves using RESTful APIs or GraphQL, where you send HTTP requests, often in JSON format, and process the server's responses. Many programming languages like Python have libraries (e.g., `requests` or `http.client`) to simplify this process. Once the API call is set up, it allows AI applications to retrieve and work with external data seamlessly, making the AI more adaptable and capable of operating in dynamic environments."

It allows AI systems to stay updated with the most current data, provides scalability by offloading certain tasks to external services, and enables seamless integration with third-party platforms. This makes AI more flexible and practical for real-world applications like e-commerce, healthcare, and autonomous systems."

          "Recently, I used API calls to build a language model (LLM) that helps users find products on Amazon based on various filters. By leveraging the Amazon Product Advertising API, I enabled the model to search for products and apply filters such as price range, customer ratings, categories, and specific features. The API allows for real-time access to product listings, reviews, and detailed descriptions, making the model capable of presenting the best options based on user preferences.",
          "The integration of multiple filters ensures that the product recommendations are not only accurate but also highly personalized. This use of API calls demonstrates how AI can enhance user experience by providing customized results, streamlining the product discovery process, and automating the decision-making flow for online shopping."

Working out was my main hobby, and I thought, \"Probably Kinesiology.\" I also dreamed of becoming a millionaire and considered studying business.",

Consistently at the top of the list were \"Computer Science,\" \"Data Science,\" and other IT-related fields. This reminded me of when I was first introduced to Scratch at age 10, JavaScript for graphics at 12, and Python at 13. I spent a week or two fiddling with them and found them fun, but I was young and more interested in exploring the world, so I didn't dive deep into any of them.",

I loved everything about Python, from its intuitiveness to the speed at which I could create applications from ideas that popped into my head. One of the first applications I created without any guidance turned out to be an application that made me thousands of dollars indirectly. Here’s how it happened:",

I used Pandas to handle the data cleanly, pixel color recognition from PyAutoGUI, and time.sleep to coordinate human-like actions that input data as fast and accurately as possible. Before my Python script, this task was done manually for years, costing the company thousands of dollars and many human hours.s"

It can process a CSV file (or Excel, TSV, etc.) and creates an object in Python called a DataFrame. Pandas mainly works with two objects: the Series and the DataFrame. The DataFrame is much more common, but the Series is important too. The Series is very similar to a Python array, while the DataFrame is akin to a 2D Python array. Here is how every data analysis project typically starts:",

You would have to convert object types to numerical types often if you want to work with numbers to extract values such as average or median.",

For example, other capabilities of Pandas include data cleaning, data manipulation, handling missing data, merging datasets, and supporting time series analysis, which means it can comprehend a wide range of time formats (with the help of the datetime library), etc. Every day, I aim to become a better data analyst, and every day, I find pandas a little cuter ;) I might drop a more advanced data analysis blog soon as I settle more in the career of data analysis or data science, so stay tuned."
