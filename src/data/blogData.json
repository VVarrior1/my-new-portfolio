To be able to do this competently, they should have a clear mind and be able to engage in deep work (referencing the book deep work by Cal Newport).",

          "Studies done on animals have shown that animals like dolphins and whales are generally smarter than animals like rhinos and cows partly due to their food sources. Dolphins and whales eat fish, which contain DHA, a type of omega-3 fatty acid that is crucial for brain development and function. On the other hand, rhinos and cows are herbivores and don't consume fish or DHA-rich foods. They are rather, eating the antidote to DHA, LA or linoleic acid, which is found in seed oils",
          "I read before that seed oils are bad for you, but this takes it a step further. Since seed oils are high in LA, and LA competes with DHA for the same enzymes, it's possible that the more LA one consumes, the dumber one gets. I can't afford this in this line of work haha.",

Just 2 weeks bed ridden could cause significant detorioration in muscles. Fasting without exercise vs fasting with exercise lead to completely different outcomes (with significant muscle retention in the latter). There is a lot more that I've read on the topic, but I can safely and confidently say that exercising regularly gives you super powers in a sedentary world. Stereotypically, my career choice as a computer science professional is largely sedentary, but I'm going against the grain with this one, ensuring I get my daily exercise in."

But to get good, we have to push through that initial tough phase.",

Working out was my main hobby, and I thought, \"Probably Kinesiology.\" I also dreamed of becoming a millionaire and considered studying business.",

Consistently at the top of the list were \"Computer Science,\" \"Data Science,\" and other IT-related fields. This reminded me of when I was first introduced to Scratch at age 10, JavaScript for graphics at 12, and Python at 13. I spent a week or two fiddling with them and found them fun, but I was young and more interested in exploring the world, so I didn't dive deep into any of them.",

One of the first applications I created without any guidance turned out to be an application that made me thousands of dollars indirectly. Here’s how it happened:",

I used Pandas to handle the data cleanly, pixel color recognition from PyAutoGUI, and time.sleep to coordinate human-like actions that input data as fast and accurately as possible. Before my Python script, this task was done manually for years, costing the company thousands of dollars and many human hours.s"

It can process a CSV file (or Excel, TSV, etc.) and creates an object in Python called a DataFrame. Pandas mainly works with two objects: the Series and the DataFrame. The DataFrame is much more common, but the Series is important too. The Series is very similar to a Python array, while the DataFrame is akin to a 2D Python array. Here is how every data analysis project typically starts:",

For example, other capabilities of Pandas include data cleaning, data manipulation, handling missing data, merging datasets, and supporting time series analysis, which means it can comprehend a wide range of time formats (with the help of the datetime library), etc. Every day, I aim to become a better data analyst, and every day, I find pandas a little cuter ;) I might drop a more advanced data analysis blog soon as I settle more in the career of data analysis or data science, so stay tuned."
