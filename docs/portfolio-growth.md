# Portfolio Growth Ideas

This document tracks enhancements that can further elevate the portfolio’s storytelling and recruiter impact.

## Gallery Feature
- **Goal**: Showcase project screenshots, design explorations, and event photos in a structured, filterable grid.
- **Content model**: title, description, tags (AI, product, team), featured flag, uploaded media, optional link to related case study.
- **UX**: masonry grid with hover metadata; lightbox view for zoom + caption; ability to surface featured images on the home page.
- **Admin tools**: drag-and-drop ordering, bulk upload, quick filters, analytics (view count, last refreshed).

## Case Study Enhancements
- Embed live demos or Loom walkthroughs highlighting architecture, demo flows, and measurable outcomes.
- Publish structured problem → solution → outcome narratives with visual metrics (charts for latency, LLM accuracy, etc.).
- Connect GitHub repos and auto-surface stars/forks for social proof.

## Signals & Social Proof
- Integrate short testimonials from founders/clients or pull quotes from LinkedIn recommendations.
- Showcase logos from programs (Google Innovate, GenLabs clients) with hover context.
- Include Lighthouse/a11y badges to highlight attention to performance and accessibility.

## Dynamic Resume Highlights
- Allow toggling between "AI/ML focus" and "Full-stack focus" to reveal tailored achievements.
- Offer downloadable recruiter packs (headshot, short bio, resume variants, curated case studies).

## Technical Deep Dives
- Publish architecture diagrams (Mermaid/Excalidraw) that interactively explain ML pipelines or system design decisions.
- Tag posts by "Agents", "ML Ops", "Product" to help recruiters dive into relevant depth quickly.

## Engagement Hooks
- Embed a calendly-style "book a coffee chat" CTA with preset 15-minute slots.
- Include a "share this portfolio" module with copy-paste snippets for LinkedIn/Twitter.

## Project Health Indicators
- Display live status badges for active products (uptime, recent deploy, stacked metrics).
- Auto-update highlights using GitHub Actions to keep data fresh before interviews.

## Analytics & Insights
- Capture per-section scroll depth to see which stories resonate; highlight top-performing case studies on the home page.
- Add content freshness reminders (e.g., nudge when a project or blog post hasn’t been updated in six months).
